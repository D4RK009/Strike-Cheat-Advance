                        service.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
                        service.features.some(feature => feature.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()));
    
    const matchesCategory = selectedCategory === "all" || service.category.toLowerCase() === selectedCategory.toLowerCase();
